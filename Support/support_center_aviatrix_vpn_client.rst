Where can I get the latest Aviatrix VPN Client?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Aviatrix VPN Client and release notes can be found at https://docs.aviatrix.com/Downloads/samlclient.html


Why does my client keep crashing regularly after connecting?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please check with your admin to see if you have any automated installs on your Aviatrix VPN Client. While the client has an established session, if the application is installed again, it will end up crashing the running client. Please ask your admin to check on the application version before pushing an install.
