ELB Status
###################################

This page provides users to view load balancer info including target health status after users launch an `Aviatrix OpenVPN Gateway <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html?highlight=ELB#vpn-access>`_ with option `Enable ELB <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#enable-elb>`_.
Additionally, users are able to delete/clean up load balancer by clicking the button "DELETE" next to the load balancer name, but usually this is not required as load balancer is automatically deleted on the last user/gateway deletion.
