=========================================================
Example Config for FortiGate VM in AWS 
=========================================================

In this document, we provide an example to set up the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall instance for you to validate that packets are indeed sent to the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall for VPC to VPC and from VPC to internet traffic inspection.

The Aviatrix Firewall Network (FireNet) workflow launches a Fortigate Next Generation Firewall instance at `Step 7a <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_workflow.html#a-launch-and-associate-firewall-instance>`_. 
After the launch is complete, the console displays the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall instance instance with its public IP address of management/egress interface and allows you either to download the .pem file for SSH access to the instance or to access the FortiGate web page.

.. note::

  Fortigate Next Generation Firewall instance has 2 interfaces as described below. Additionally, firewall instance eth1 is on the same subnet as FireNet gateway eth2 interface.

========================================================         ===============================          ================================

========================================================         ===============================          ================================
eth0 (on subnet -Public-FW-ingress-egress-AZ-a)                  Egress or Untrusted interface            Allow ALL 
eth1 (on subnet -gw-dmz-firewall)                                LAN or Trusted interface                 Allow ALL (Do not change)
========================================================         ===============================          ================================


Below are the steps for initial setup.

1. Download Fortigate Next Generation Firewall Access Key
----------------------------------

After `Step 7a <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_workflow.html#a-launch-and-associate-firewall-instance>`_ is completed, you'll see the Download button as below. Click the button to download the .pem file.

If you get a download error, usually it means the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall instance is not ready. Wait until it is ready, refresh the browser and then try again.

2. Login to Fortigate Next Generation Firewall
----------------------------------

Go back to the Aviatrix Controller Console. 
Go to Firewall Network workflow, `Step 7a <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_workflow.html#a-launch-and-associate-firewall-instance>`_. Click on the `Management UI`. It takes you to the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall you just launched.

|v2_avx_management_UI|

.. note::

  Login with Username "admin". Default password is the instance-id.

3. Reset Fortigate Next Generation Firewall Password
--------------------------------

Once logged in with the default password, it will ask you to set a new password.

4. Configure Fortigate Next Generation Firewall port1 with WAN
-------------------------------------------------

Once logged in with the new password, go to the page "Network -> Interfaces" to configure Physical Interface port1 as the following screenshot.

  - Select the interface with port 1 and click on "Edit"
  - Specify appropriate role (WAN)
  - Enter an Alias (i.e: WAN) for the interface
  - Enable DHCP to ensure FW retrieve private IP information from AWS console
  - Enable “Retrieve default gateway from server" 
  
|v2_fortigate_interface_wan|

5. Configure Fortigate Next Generation Firewall port2 with LAN
-------------------------------------------------

Go to the page "Network -> Interfaces" to configure Physical Interface port2 as the following screenshot.

  - Select the interface with port 2 and click on "Edit"
  - Specify appropriate role (LAN)
  - Enter an Alias (i.e: LAN) for the interface
  - Enable DHCP to ensure FW retrieve private IP information from AWS console
  - Disable “Retrieve default gateway from server" 
  
|v2_fortigate_interface_lan|

6. Create static routes for routing of traffic VPC to VPC
-------------------------------------------------

Packets to and from TGW VPCs, as well as on-premises, will be hairpinned off of the LAN interface. As such, we will need to configure appropriate route ranges that you expect traffic for packets that need to be forward back to TGW. 
For simplicity, you can configure the FW to send all RFC 1918 packets to LAN port, which sends the packets back to the TGW. 

In this example, we configure all traffic for RFC 1918 to be sent out of the LAN interface.

Go to tha page "Network -> State Routes" to create a Static Route as the following screenshot.

  - Click on the button "Create New"
  - Enter the destination route in the "Destination" box
  - In the "Gateway Address" box, you will need to enter the AWS default gateway IP on subnet -gw-dmz-firewall
  
  .. note::
    
    i.e. subnet CIDR for -gw-dmz-firewall is 10.66.0.96/28, thus the AWS default gateway IP on this subnet is 10.66.0.97
  
  - Interface will be the LAN (port2)
  - Configure an appropriate admin distance if you expect overlapping routes that need to be prioritized
  - Enter comments as necessary.
  - Repeat the above steps for RFC 1918 routes

Those static routes also could be reviewed on the page "Monitor -> Routing Monitor"

7. Configure basic traffic policy to allow traffic VPC to VPC
-------------------------------------------------

In this step, we will configure a basic traffic security policy that allows traffic to pass through the firewall. Given that Aviatrix gateways will only forward traffic from the TGW to the LAN port of the Firewall, we can simply set our policy condition to match any packet that is going in/out of LAN interface.

Go to the page "Policy & Objects -> IPv4 Policy -> Create New / Edit" to configure policy as the following screenshot.

==================  ===============================================
**Field**           **Value**
==================  ===============================================
Name                Configure any name for this policy
Incoming Interface  LAN (port2)
Outgoing Interface  LAN (port2)
Source              Click on the + sign and add all
Destination         Click on the + sign and add all
Schedule            always
Service             ALL
Action              ACCEPT
NAT                 Disabled
==================  ===============================================

After validating that your TGW traffic is being routed through your firewall instances, you can customize the security policy to tailor to your requirements.

|v2_fortigate_policy_vpc_to_vpc|

8. [Optional] Configure basic traffic policy to allow traffic VPC to Internet
-------------------------------------------------

In this step, we will configure a basic traffic security policy that allows internet traffic to pass through the firewall. Given that Aviatrix gateways will only forward traffic from the TGW to the LAN port of the Firewall, we can simply set our policy condition to match any packet that is going in of LAN interface and going out of WAN interface.

.. important::
  Enable `Egress inspection <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_faq.html#how-do-i-enable-egress-inspection-on-firenet>`_ feature on FireNet
  
First of all, go back to the Aviatrix Controller Console. Navigate to the page "Firewall Network -> Advanced". Click the skewer/three dot button. Scroll down to “Egress through Firewall” and click Enable. Verify the Egress status on the page "Firewall Network -> Advanced".

|v2_avx_egress_inspection|

Secondly, go back to the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall console and navigate to the page "Policy & Objects -> IPv4 Policy -> Create New / Edit" to configure policy as the following screenshot.

==================  ===============================================
**Field**           **Value**
==================  ===============================================
Name                Configure any name for this policy
Incoming Interface  LAN (port2)
Outgoing Interface  WAN (port1)
Source              Click on the + sign and add all
Destination         Click on the + sign and add all
Schedule            always
Service             ALL
Action              ACCEPT
NAT                 Enable
==================  ===============================================

.. important::

  NAT function needs to be enabled on this VPC to Internet policy

After validating that your TGW traffic is being routed through your firewall instances, you can customize the security policy to tailor to your requirements.

|v2_fortigate_policy_vpc_to_internet|

9. Ready to go!
----------------

Now your firewall instance is ready to receive packets! 

The next step is to specify which Security Domain needs packet inspection by defining a connection policy that connects to
the firewall domain. This is done by `Step 8 <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_workflow.html#specify-security-domain-for-firewall-inspection>`_ in the Firewall Network workflow. 

For example, deploy Spoke-1 VPC in Security_Domain_1 and Spoke-2 VPC in Security_Domain_2. Build a connection policy between the two domains. Build a connection between Security_Domain_2 to Firewall Domain. 

For traffic VPC to VPC, launch one instance in Spoke-1 VPC and Spoke-2 VPC. From one instance, ping to the private IP of other instance. The ping should go through and be inspected on firewall.

[Optional] For traffic VPC to Internet, launch one private instance in either Spoke-1 VPC or Spoke-2 VPC. From one private instance, ping to the Internet service. The ping should go through and be inspected on firewall.  

10. View Traffic Log
----------------------

You can view if traffic is forwarded to the firewall instance by logging in to the Fortigate Next Generation Firewall console. Go to the page "FortiView -> Destinations". Start ping packets from one Spoke VPC to another Spoke VPC where one or both of Security Domains are connected to Firewall Network Security Domain.

|v2_fortigate_view_traffic_log_vpc_to_vpc|

[Optional] Start ping packets from VPC to Internet to verify egress function if it is enabled.
