Aviatrix APIs
===========================

Aviatrix API is a programmable interface for querying information from and making changes to the Controller for the 
networking and networking security features the Controller manages. The API runs over HTTPS protocol. 

Aviatrix API is RPC based where API endpoints are actions. Examples of RPC based APIs are `Slack Web API <https://api.slack.com/web#responses>`_ and `AWS API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_.
